Retiming Animation tool for toolsdev Assignment 03.

After mutiple failed attempts of me trying to reverse engineer this tool, I finally decided to
just follow Chris's tutorial regarding this tool. As a result, I decided to implement three new
features that weren't present in Chris's tutorials. Those are:
  1. Move to Start
  2. Ripple Delete
  3. Clean-up Keys
